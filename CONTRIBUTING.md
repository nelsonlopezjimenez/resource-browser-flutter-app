## Code Style Guidelines

### Dart Conventions

```dart
// Good: Clear, descriptive names
class ResourceItem { }
String fileName;
void loadResources() { }

// Bad: Unclear names
class RI { }
String fn;
void load() { }
```

### Comments

```dart
// Good: Explains WHY
// Sort by name to match user expectations
resources.sort((a, b) => a.name.compareTo(b.name));

// Bad: Explains obvious WHAT
// Sort the resources
resources.sort((a, b) => a.name.compareTo(b.name));
```

### Documentation Comments

```dart
/// Creates a new ResourceItem from a file path.
/// 
/// The [filePath] should be a relative path from the web root.
/// Returns a ResourceItem with type auto-detected from extension.
factory ResourceItem.fromPath(String filePath) {
  // Implementation
}
```
