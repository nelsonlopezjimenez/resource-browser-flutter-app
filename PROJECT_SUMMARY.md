- No complex patterns (yet!)

### 3. Minimal Dependencies
Only essential packages:
- `flutter_markdown` for markdown
- `syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer` for PDFs
- `video_player` for videos
- `http` for fetching files

### 4. No Backend Required
- Works with static files
- Simple manifest-based approach
- Easy to deploy anywhere

### 5. Progressive Enhancement
Built to be enhanced incrementally:
- Start simple (this version)
- Add features gradually
- Clear path for improvements

## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Change Colors
```dart
